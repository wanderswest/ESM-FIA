# ESM-FIA: Empirical Succession Mapping - R code

Forests are amazing! 

Explore this R code and associated filtered US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to build the Empirical Succession Mapping and perform analyses. Current analyses:

 Figure 1. Empirical Succession Mapping
 
 Figure 2. 5-year self thinning relationships to disturbance
 
 Figure 3. Influence of climate conditions (temperature & moisture anomalies)
 
 Figure 4. Forward modeling of eastern US forest carbon steady-states

Refer to FIA manual for further details on each variable:
